   Welcome to the rocking world of this Melody project, undertaken by three UniBo students: Gilda Gitto, Serena Sciortino, and Vito Antonio Miccoli, as part of the course "Information and Technology Skills" by Professor Valentina Presutti.
This Melody project takes you on an exciting exploration of the rock genre in two diverse regions, the United States of America and Spain. As passionate music enthusiasts, we have explored deeply the historical significance of rock music in these countries.
Additionally, we created another story to analyse the basis of the rock genre in order to create a link between our two stories. Drawing inspiration from the realm of the Polifonia Corpus and exploring the MusicBo module  we have used data to create three stories.
Our journey started with a deep dive into the Polifonia Corpus with the Corpus interrogation tool. The Module MusicBo on the Polifonia corpus was used to discover the most common words related to Music. For example: we focused on music bands since the lemma “band” appeared in the corpus in 593 sentences. Very similarly, the lemma “USA” appeared 583 times. So we decided to analyse these sentences and create a story involving music bands in the USA, focusing on the Rock genre because its lemma was associated with 110 words. Since we wanted to explore the rock genre we decided to do a comparison with Spain, which is not as famous as the United States for its rock bands, finding a lemma related to its music: “Spanish” appeared in the MusicBo Module 39 times.
After the first step, we used FRED’S graph to structure our queries and to obtain properties. Then, we also tapped into the vast knowledge graph of Wikidata, using SPARQL queries to gather a wealth of relevant information. By embracing a data-driven approach, we have developed hypotheses, tested and validated them through the creation of SPARQL queries.
Our efforts have culminated in the creation of two engaging Melody stories which were the base for our two Data Journalism articles. 
To make our work accessible to a wider audience, we have published a website on GitHub, providing a platform for music enthusiasts to explore our findings. 
This project has been an interesting journey but a very difficult one. We have experienced difficulties using FRED because we were not familiar with it and with its graphs, but the initial obstacle to overcome was building queries. Overall, it was difficult because Wikidata is limited and sometimes it did not show the results we expected. However, the most challenging part was using the melody website because sometimes our data got lost due to technical problems, that we managed thanks to the help of a Melody collaborator. However, although the problems we are proud of our project, especially because we are languages students and we did something which was out of our comfort zone. 
In summary, the Melody project has been an engaging and enriching journey for us as students, allowing us to deepen our understanding of the rock genre in general and of the rock genre in the United States and Spain through the lenses of data analysis and storytelling. Without further ado, we proudly present the articles based on our Melody stories: 
Discovering Rock Bands in Spain, Discovering Rock Bands in the USA, Rock Music: Behind the Scenes. Thank you for joining us on this captivating adventure.
